    "\n",
    "##### What to expect in King county?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Average Price: 450,000\n",
    "    3 bedrooms / 2.25 bathrooms\n",
    "    Living area around 1,910 square feet + Backyard\n",
    "    Build in the 70's\n",
    "    Average condition, will need minor repairs\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How zipcode affects price?Â¶\n",
    "No relatioship can be stablished between zipcode and price, its correlation is very close to 0. About 42% of zipcodes are missing in the dataset, that can affect the relation with price. (Zip codes in King County: 120; zip codes in the set: 70\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Does the age of a house has an impact on its price?\n",
    "There seems to be no stablished correlation, only a few houses built in the past few years appear to be at a high cost.\n",
